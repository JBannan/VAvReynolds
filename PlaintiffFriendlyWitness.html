                Plaintiff Witness: CauliflowerOnline
                Representative
        </h2>
        <p>
                CauliflowerOnline is an email service provider with hundreds of thousands of users. The 
                company was founded with the mission of giving users an efficient communication platform. 
                CauliflowerOnline has always operated with the goal of providing uninterrupted service to 
                its users; for this reason, it has kept its user base relatively small, at least as far 
                as email service providers go.
        </p>
        <p>
            In its eight years of operation, CauliflowerOnline has served its users well, carrying out its 
            operations satisfactorily. Emails would pass through their servers, located in Fairfax, Virginia, 
            with impressive speed, to the point that the company often received compliments from its users. 
            Then, one day, the CauliflowerOnline servers slowed tremendously. The company’s logs showed that 
            emails had been transmitted en mass to nearly fifteen thousand of the company’s account-holders. 
            This of course alarmed the company’s management; with the CauliflowerOnline being as small as 
            it is, the wave of emails was unprecedented in the company’s history. Though the company’s 
            leaders at first decided to just take this hit, assuming that it would not happen again, they 
            were shocked when another twelve thousand emails passed through their server eight days later, 
            another nineteen thousand emails only three days after that, and a final nine thousand the 
            following day. By that time, they had determined by checking the server logs that the emails had 
            all originated from a man named Jeremy Reynolds, who had sent the emails on behalf of 
            GoodIntentions of Greater Washington, a charity organization.

                    CauliflowerOnline’s servers are located in Fairfax, Virginia. Through CauliflowerOnline’s 
                    servers, Jeremy Reynolds sent, on multiple occasions, masses of more than ten thousand 
                    emails within a one-day period. The emails which Reynolds distributed featured advertised 
                    the sale of merchandise. Because so many emails passed through CauliflowerOnline’s servers all at once, 
                    and since the company is only a regional service provider and thus smaller-scale in operation, 
                    the company's servers were not as robust, and so their regular operation was impacted heavily, 
                    resulting in numerous complaints from its users.

            <p style="margin-top: 1px;">
                    The emails were meant to benefit GoodIntentions, which is a charitable organization; also, 
                    because it was indeterminable that GoodIntentions generated any sizable revenue from the 
                    promotional emails, CauliflowerOnline would have a difficult time proving that they profited 
                    at the expense of CauliflowerOnline’s servers and performance.
