            Plaintiff Witness: Redford Herring, Attorney
            General of the Commonwealth of Virginia
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Honourable Redford Herring, Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Virginia, 
            is the acting power of attorney for the state government, and is seeking to prosecute 
            the defendant on violations of the ‘TUBES’ (transmission of unsolicited bulk electronic 
            mails) statute of the Virginia Computer Crimes Act.

        <p>
                Long before his election as a public official for the state government, he worked his 
                way up after graduating with honors from the UVA School of Law by taking small 
                clerking positions here and there, and then working as associate corporate counsel 
                for several medium-sized companies, one of which happened to be CauliflowerOnline 
                Corporation (then known by its founding name, Broccol-eMail, Inc.); this tenure lasted 
                from 1996-2002. He continued in corporate law for a brief time after this before 
                establishing his own practice, Red Herring Law Firm, P.C. in 2004, being the principal 
                associate until he ventured into public office by being elected chief deputy attorney 
                general by voters in a special election in 2010; he has been re-elected twice since then 
                (in 2012 and 2016, respectively).

            <p style="margin-top: 1px;">
                    Having a storied history as a law practitioner, Mr. Herring is knowledgeable regarding 
                    the state’s anti-spam laws; he interjected himself into the case on behalf of the state 
                    police whose cybercrimes division wanted to go after the defendant (Mr. Reynolds) after 
                    tracing the bulk emails back to him.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0%;"><strong>Pro-Defendant Knowledge:</strong>
            <p style="margin-top: 1px;">
                    Due to his publicized history with the CauliflowerOnline organization (albeit under its 
                    former name), he could present a potential conflict of interest that the defense 
                    could assert as justification for having the case thrown out.
