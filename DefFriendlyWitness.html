                Defendant Witness: GoodIntentions
                charity Representative
        </h2>
        <p>
            GoodIntentions Charity is a unique charity that aims to help the 
            impoverished through the sale of our merchandise in our retail 
            stores. We opened our stores for the sole purpose of helping people 
            and families throughout the area. We do not operate to make a profit. 
            That is why we are registered as a non-profit organization. We as a 
            group only have good intentions in whatever action that we take. It 
            was with that idea that we called ourselves the GoodIntentions charity.

            The main goal of GoodIntentions was to create awareness of our existence. 
            Since everyone has an email account these we decided that sending 
            people emails about our mission and our methods would bring about 
            a greater awareness in people of what we do. One of our employees, 
            Jeremy Reynolds, was astute enough to notice that the only way to help 
            more people was to reach out to people and let them know of our purpose. 
            He decided that sending emails with our motivations and purpose with a 
            few merchandise was the best way to reach out to new people. Through a 
            business partner he was able to obtain mailing lists of people from 
            CauliflowerOnline among other email services. It was a fully legal 
            approach to expanding our network of potential customers, who are 
            also donors when they make purchases at GoodIntentions.

            The focus of the emails were the message to help those who were 
            impoverished. That was the only goal. There was of course some 
            merchandise in the emails but that was just an aside on the 
            overall plan. They were there solely so that if the recipients 
            felt compelled enough to donate after reading our cause then they 
            could choose to do so. Jeremy having the technical knowledge about 
            these things decided to send mass emails to people in hopes to get 
            more donations. He had only good intentions in mind while he did this. 
            He reasoned that the more emails we send the more people will be 
            compelled to look at our message. There was no hidden motivation 
            to gain money. As we have said before, we are a non-profit organization. 
            Profit is the last thing we are after. We only want to help those in need.

                The emails contained merchandise that were available for sale. 
                One of the side goals was to receive donations from the email recipients 
                as well. The placement of merchandise was intentional; thus, GoodIntentions 
                intended to profit off sales generated from the contents of the emails.

            <p style="margin-top: 1px;">
                The email list was obtained legally. The charity attempted to enumerate 
                the amount of funds generated from the clicks on the links in the emails; 
                they determined it to be a total revenue of around $23,000, well below 
                the $50,000 limit outlined in the Va Code for holding a defendant liable 
                for spam. The profits from any merchandise sold to customers directed from 
                the emails go towards paying GoodIntentions employees first (not 
                'administrative costs' as many charities do), and then 95 percent of the 
                remaining money goes towards funding all of the community services 
                GoodIntentions provides.
