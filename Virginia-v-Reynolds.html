            You have been given a list of cases specific to your trial to help you 
            complete Trial Prep assignments. These cases are all accessible 
            directly via Nexis Uni: 
            <a href="https://advance-lexis-com.mutex.gmu.edu/bisacademicresearchhome/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=9ce0d05a-5d8d-41de-876f-93215e22af51&ecomp=z8qgk&prid=483d43fc-35b7-4dc2-8da0-422ad0fc1798"></a>

                At least three of the cases in this bank will be useful to your 
                side of the trial, regardless of whether you are representing the 
                plaintiff or the defendant. Read the cases carefully! Some may be 
                helpful to both plaintiff and defendant (in different ways). Be 
                aware that both prosecution and defense are sharing this bank of 
                cases. You will need to examine the cases that are most helpful 
                to your argument, but you should also be familiar with the cases 
                that are most helpful to your opponents' arguments and be prepared 
                to respond to them. Also, use the skills you learned in the legal 
                research assignment to ensure that your cases are both properly 
                shepardized and are binding precedent in Virginia. Some cases may 
                have been overturned or be otherwise unhelpful. 
                <strong>
                    THE CASES YOU SELECT ARE NOT BINDING PRECEDENT UNLESS THEY 
                    ARE FROM A VIRGINIA APPELLATE COURT OR A FEDERAL COURT THAT 
                    HAS JURISDICTION OVER VIRGINIA.

            Plaintiff witness: Redford Herring, Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Virginia - 
            Reynolds sent over 12,000 unsolicited bulk emails (SPAM) to users of 
            CauliflowerOnline’s email service on 4 separate occasions.
        </p>
        <p>
                Plaintiff witness: CauliflowerOnline Representative - Emails advertising 
                the GoodIntentions charity were transmitted through the company's servers 
                located in Fairfax, Virginia. The emails caused a noticeable burden on the 
                servers, though CauliflowerOnline received very few complaints about the 
                emails from users.
        </p>
        <p>
                Defendant witness: Jeremy Reynolds - Reynolds sent emails to users of the 
                CauliflowerOnline email service. These emails advertised the GoodIntentions 
                charity and its mission. This advertisement also mentioned the retail stores 
                and merchandise available for purchase that would go towards the charity’s 
                mission. These emails also gave the recipient the option to opt out of 
                receiving future emails.
        </p>
        <p>
                Defendant witness: GoodIntentions charity Representative - Mailing lists 
                for CauliflowerOnline were obtained via a business partner along with other 
                email service providers. Promotional materials were distributed to these 
                mailing lists on behalf of the organization, a registered 501(c)(3) 
                non-profit organization.

            Plaintiff Witness: Redford Herring, Attorney
            General of the Commonwealth of Virginia
        </p>
        <p>
            The Honourable Redford Herring, Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Virginia, 
            is the acting power of attorney for the state government, and is seeking to prosecute 
            the defendant on violations of the ‘TUBES’ (transmission of unsolicited bulk electronic 
            mails) statute of the Virginia Computer Crimes Act.
        </p>
        <p>
                Long before his election as a public official for the state government, he worked his 
                way up after graduating with honors from the UVA School of Law by taking small 
                clerking positions here and there, and then working as associate corporate counsel 
                for several medium-sized companies, one of which happened to be CauliflowerOnline 
                Corporation (then known by its founding name, Broccol-eMail, Inc.); this tenure lasted 
                from 1996-2002. He continued in corporate law for a brief time after this before 
                establishing his own practice, Red Herring Law Firm, P.C. in 2004, being the principal 
                associate until he ventured into public office by being elected chief deputy attorney 
                general by voters in a special election in 2010; he has been re-elected twice since then 
                (in 2012 and 2016, respectively).

            <p style="margin-top: 1px;">
                    Having a storied history as a law practitioner, Mr. Herring is knowledgeable regarding 
                    the state’s anti-spam laws; he interjected himself into the case on behalf of the state 
                    police whose cybercrimes division wanted to go after the defendant (Mr. Reynolds) after 
                    tracing the bulk emails back to him.

            <p style="margin-top: 1px;">
                    Due to his publicized history with the CauliflowerOnline organization (albeit under its 
                    former name), he could present a potential conflict of interest that the defense 
                    could assert as justification for having the case thrown out.

                Plaintiff Witness: CauliflowerOnline
                Representative
        </p>
        <p>
                CauliflowerOnline is an email service provider with hundreds of thousands of users. The 
                company was founded with the mission of giving users an efficient communication platform. 
                CauliflowerOnline has always operated with the goal of providing uninterrupted service to 
                its users; for this reason, it has kept its user base relatively small, at least as far 
                as email service providers go.
        </p>
        <p>
            In its eight years of operation, CauliflowerOnline has served its users well, carrying out its 
            operations satisfactorily. Emails would pass through their servers, located in Fairfax, Virginia, 
            with impressive speed, to the point that the company often received compliments from its users. 
            Then, one day, the CauliflowerOnline servers slowed tremendously. The company’s logs showed that 
            emails had been transmitted en mass to nearly fifteen thousand of the company’s account-holders. 
            This of course alarmed the company’s management; with the CauliflowerOnline being as small as 
            it is, the wave of emails was unprecedented in the company’s history. Though the company’s 
            leaders at first decided to just take this hit, assuming that it would not happen again, they 
            were shocked when another twelve thousand emails passed through their server eight days later, 
            another nineteen thousand emails only three days after that, and a final nine thousand the 
            following day. By that time, they had determined by checking the server logs that the emails had 
            all originated from a man named Jeremy Reynolds, who had sent the emails on behalf of 
            GoodIntentions of Greater Washington, a charity organization.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0%;"><strong>Pro-Plaintiff Knowledge:</strong>
            <p style="margin-top: 1px;">
                    CauliflowerOnline’s servers are located in Fairfax, Virginia. Through CauliflowerOnline’s 
                    servers, Jeremy Reynolds sent, on multiple occasions, masses of more than ten thousand 
                    emails within a one-day period. The emails which Reynolds distributed featured advertised 
                    the sale of merchandise.
            </p>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0%;"><strong>Pro-Defendant Knowledge:</strong>
            <p style="margin-top: 1px;">
                    Though so many emails passed through CauliflowerOnline’s servers all at once, the company’s 
                    servers are incredibly robust, and so their regular operation was impacted only slightly. 
                    For this reason, the CauliflowerOnline received only a handful of complaints from its users. 
                    In addition, the emails were meant to benefit GoodIntentions, which is a charitable organization.
