            Plaintiff witness: Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Virginia - 
            Reynolds sent over 12,000 unsolicited bulk emails (SPAM) to users of 
            CauliflowerOnline’s email service on 4 separate occasions.
        </p>
        <p>
                Plaintiff witness: CauliflowerOnline Representative - Emails advertising 
                the GoodIntentions charity were transmitted through the company's servers 
                located in Fairfax, Virginia. The emails caused a noticeable burden on the 
                servers, though CauliflowerOnline received very few complaints about the 
                emails from users.
        </p>
        <p>
                Defendant witness: Jeremy Reynolds - Reynolds sent emails to users of the 
                CauliflowerOnline email service. These emails advertised the GoodIntentions 
                charity and its mission. This advertisement also mentioned the retail stores 
                and merchandise available for purchase that would go towards the charity’s 
                mission. These emails also gave the recipient the option to opt out of 
                receiving future emails.
        </p>
        <p>
                Defendant witness: GoodIntentions charity Representative - Mailing lists 
                for CauliflowerOnline were obtained via a business partner along with other 
                email service providers. Promotional materials were distributed to these 
                mailing lists on behalf of the organization, a registered 501(c)(3) 
                non-profit organization.
