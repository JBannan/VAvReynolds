        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            The company CauliflowerOnline provides an email service with thousands of 
            registered users. They are able to provide high quality service to their 
            users across the east coast due to their server hubs that handle email 
            transmission for specified regions. One of these hubs is located in Fairfax, 
            Virginia. Jeremy Reynolds is a member of GoodIntentions of Greater Washington, 
            a non-profit organization known for retail stores across the D.C. 
            metropolitan area. GoodIntentions uses the funds received from their retail 
            sales and purchases of merchandise to further their mission to help impoverished 
            families in the D.C. metro area.
        </p>
        <h3>Scenario</h3>
        <p>
            Jeremy Reynolds obtained an email list of users registered with CauliflowerOnline 
            and other email service providers and sent over 12,000 unsolicited bulk emails to 
            these users on 4 separate occasions advertising the charity’s mission and retail 
            locations. The emails presented an overview of GoodIntentions’ history and how 
            they achieve their mission. The emails also suggested purchasing merchandise, 
            donating items to the stores, and shopping at the stores to support the charity 
            and its mission. With this sudden rush of emails, CauliflowerOnline noticed a 
            brief spike in activity being placed on their servers.

                XMission, L.C. v. Click Sales, Inc., 2019 U.S. Dist.
            </a>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                This case revolved around alleged violations of 15 USCS § 7701 of the CAN-SPAM 
                Act, as XMission, an ISP, alleged irreparable harm to its reputation based on 
                slowed speeds as a result of 116,000 commercial emails sent promoting Click 
                Sales products.
            </li>
            <li>
                    This case corresponds to the quantity of SPAM as well as the adverse 
                    effect legal elements, as they proved the amount of spam passing through 
                    their servers caused traffic to slow and (long-term), a loss of customers.
            </li>
            <li>
                    The case ruled in XMission’s favor, thus, helps the plaintiff if they 
                    prove an adverse effect as a result of bulk emails transmitting through their 
                    servers.

                    Concerns revenue from SPAM legal element; if revenue from SPAM is 
                    generated at the expense of the plaintiff, it is grounds for a lawsuit. 
                    The plaintiff was a student suing a mortgage company (the defendant) 
                    for sending unsolicited bulk emails; he then spoofed a company email 
                    address and sent thousands of emails of a nonprofit himself. The 
                    mortgage company countersued alleging racketeering.

        <h3>Ethical Question:</h3>
        <p><strong>
            Is it ethical for a non-profit organization to send emails soliciting money
            from sales transactions if for a non-commercial purpose?

            Article outlining the federal guidelines that all commercial companies sending 
            promotional emails must comply with; since there is no exemption for non-profit 
            organizations (like GoodIntentions), they also are beholden to these guidelines.

                Article on a study conducted by a charity consultancy on the success (open) 
                rate of charity solicitation emails, and why non-profit organizations are 
                increasing the amount of emails they send to mailing lists (the study shows 
                increasing monetary returns based on the responses to the survey,

        <p>To hold the defendant liable under Virginia law, the plaintiff must prove:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Reynolds used a computer or computer network located in Virginia in 
                order to send the emails to CauliflowerOnline’s users. If Reynolds 
                used a computer outside of the state, the emails must have been 
                transmitted through CauliflowerOnline’s servers in Fairfax.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            To hold the hold the defendant liable for spam, the plaintiff must prove 
            one of the following under Va. Code Ann. Section 18.2-152.3:1:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                    The volume of spam transmitted exceeded 10,000 attempted recipients 
                    in a 24 hour period, 100,000 attempted recipients in any 30-day time 
                    period, or one million attempted recipients in any one-year time period.
            </li>
            <li>
                    The revenue generated from a specific spam exceeded $1,000 or the total 
                    revenue generated from all spam transmitted to any EMSP exceeded $ 50,000.

        <ol>
            <li>
                    The defendant caused an adverse effect or significant, presentable burden

                    as a result of frequently sent emails. If no opt-out or unsubscribe options 
                    are clearly presented to recipients, a presentable burden on their inbox or 
                    spam filters would suffice.

                At least three of the cases in this bank will be useful to your 
                side of the trial, regardless of whether you are representing the 
                plaintiff or the defendant. Read the cases carefully! Some may be 
                helpful to both plaintiff and defendant (in different ways). Be 
                aware that both prosecution and defense are sharing this bank of 
                cases. You will need to examine the cases that are most helpful 
                to your argument, but you should also be familiar with the cases 
                that are most helpful to your opponents' arguments and be prepared 
                to respond to them. Also, use the skills you learned in the legal 
                research assignment to ensure that your cases are both properly 
                shepardized and are binding precedent in Virginia. Some cases may 
                have been overturned or be otherwise unhelpful.

        <p>
            <em>Plaintiff witness: Redford Herring, Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Virginia</em> - 
            Reynolds sent over 12,000 unsolicited bulk emails (SPAM) to users of 
            CauliflowerOnline’s email service on 4 separate occasions.
        </p>
        <p>
                <em>Plaintiff witness: CauliflowerOnline Representative</em> - Emails advertising 
                the GoodIntentions charity were transmitted through the company's servers 
                located in Fairfax, Virginia. The emails caused a noticeable burden on the 
                servers, though CauliflowerOnline received very few complaints about the 
                emails from users.
        </p>
        <p>
                <em>Defendant witness: Jeremy Reynolds</em> - Reynolds sent emails to users of the 
                CauliflowerOnline email service. These emails advertised the GoodIntentions 
                charity and its mission. This advertisement also mentioned the retail stores 
                and merchandise available for purchase that would go towards the charity’s 
                mission. These emails also gave the recipient the option to opt out of 
                receiving future emails.
        </p>
        <p>

            Plaintiff Witness: Redford Herring, Attorney
            General of the Commonwealth of Virginia
        </strong></p>
        <p>
            The Honourable Redford Herring, Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Virginia, 
            is the acting power of attorney for the state government, and is seeking to prosecute 
            the defendant on violations of the ‘TUBES’ (transmission of unsolicited bulk electronic 
            mails) statute of the Virginia Computer Crimes Act.
        </p>
        <p>
                Long before his election as a public official for the state government, he worked his 
                way up after graduating with honors from the UVA School of Law by taking small 
                clerking positions here and there, and then working as associate corporate counsel 
                for several medium-sized companies, one of which happened to be CauliflowerOnline 
                Corporation (then known by its founding name, Broccol-eMail, Inc.); this tenure lasted 
                from 1996-2002. He continued in corporate law for a brief time after this before 
                establishing his own practice, Red Herring Law Firm, P.C. in 2004, being the principal 
                associate until he ventured into public office by being elected chief deputy attorney 
                general by voters in a special election in 2010; he has been re-elected twice since then 
                (in 2012 and 2016, respectively).

                    Having a storied history as a law practitioner, Mr. Herring is knowledgeable regarding 
                    the state’s anti-spam laws; he interjected himself into the case on behalf of the state 
                    police whose cybercrimes division wanted to go after the defendant (Mr. Reynolds) after 
                    tracing the bulk emails back to him.

                    Due to his publicized history with the CauliflowerOnline organization (albeit under its 
                    former name), he could present a potential conflict of interest that the defense 
                    could assert as justification for having the case thrown out.

                Plaintiff Witness: CauliflowerOnline
                Representative
        </strong></p>
        <p>
                CauliflowerOnline is an email service provider with hundreds of thousands of users. The 
                company was founded with the mission of giving users an efficient communication platform. 
                CauliflowerOnline has always operated with the goal of providing uninterrupted service to 
                its users; for this reason, it has kept its user base relatively small, at least as far 
                as email service providers go.
        </p>
        <p>
            In its eight years of operation, CauliflowerOnline has served its users well, carrying out its 
            operations satisfactorily. Emails would pass through their servers, located in Fairfax, Virginia, 
            with impressive speed, to the point that the company often received compliments from its users. 
            Then, one day, the CauliflowerOnline servers slowed tremendously. The company’s logs showed that 
            emails had been transmitted en mass to nearly fifteen thousand of the company’s account-holders. 
            This of course alarmed the company’s management; with the CauliflowerOnline being as small as 
            it is, the wave of emails was unprecedented in the company’s history. Though the company’s 
            leaders at first decided to just take this hit, assuming that it would not happen again, they 
            were shocked when another twelve thousand emails passed through their server eight days later, 
            another nineteen thousand emails only three days after that, and a final nine thousand the 
            following day. By that time, they had determined by checking the server logs that the emails had 
            all originated from a man named Jeremy Reynolds, who had sent the emails on behalf of 
            GoodIntentions of Greater Washington, a charity organization.
        </p>

                    CauliflowerOnline’s servers are located in Fairfax, Virginia. Through CauliflowerOnline’s 
                    servers, Jeremy Reynolds sent, on multiple occasions, masses of more than ten thousand 
                    emails within a one-day period. The emails which Reynolds distributed featured advertised 
                    the sale of merchandise.

            <p style="margin-top: 1px;">
                    Though so many emails passed through CauliflowerOnline’s servers all at once, the company’s 
                    servers are incredibly robust, and so their regular operation was impacted only slightly. 
                    For this reason, the CauliflowerOnline received only a handful of complaints from its users. 
                    In addition, the emails were meant to benefit GoodIntentions, which is a charitable organization.

        </strong></p>
        <p>
            Jeremy Reynolds is a member of GoodIntentions of Greater Washington. GoodIntentions 
            is a non-profit organization known for retail stores across the D.C. metropolitan area. 
            Jeremy Reynolds has been a renowned member of GoodIntentions charity for a long time. 
            Jeremy Reynolds has a good history of being a charitable member of GoodIntention and 
            his work for the better future of the impoverished has also been appreciated by many.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jeremy Reynolds has been looking over to expand the charity reach and also gather more 
            and more charity for the impoverished who are benefited by GoodIntentions. To get greater 
            attention to the GoodIntentions and how the charity is being done for the impoverished 
            by the GoodIntentions, Jeremy Reynolds decided to send out emails. Reynolds gathered 
            the emails of users of CauliflowerOnline email service, knowing that CauliflowerOnline 
            has a reliable server which has users who might be willing to help the good cause. To 
            spread the history of GoodIntentions and how the organization achieves their mission, 
            Reynolds sent out over 12,000 unsolicited emails to users of CauliflowerOnline on 4 
            separate occasions. These emails contained an overview of work done by the GoodIntentions 
            and how the charity works. The email also contained the advertisement of the merchandise 
            and the stores which help the charity done by GoodIntentions. The emails contained the 
            information that when a merchandise is being purchased from the mentioned retail stores, 
            the profits are donated to the charity which supports GoodIntentions. Reynolds was sending 
            out these emails, thinking that it was protected speech as the emails were helping the 
            charity of GoodIntentions and did not support major commercial advertisement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Knowing that some users of CauliflowerOnline might not be interested in receiving any 
            further emails about GoodIntention and its charity, Reynolds also included an “opt out” 
            option in the emails so that the users can avoid receiving any more emails from GoodIntention. 
            This option was introduced to provide convenience to any users who would not like any more 
            emails from GoodIntentions.

                The email addresses of the users of CauliflowerOnline were obtained by 
                Jeremy Reynolds from the business partners of GoodIntentions. The emails 
                were indeed non-commercial in nature but did violate the spam laws as they 
                still appeared to be unsolicited. The emails sent to the users of 
                CauliflowerOnline contained merchandise which in a sense advertised the 
                merchandise more than the message of the good cause by GoodIntentions charity.

                    Jeremy Reynolds had no intention to spread the commercial 
                    nature of their charity, the emails were only to spread the 
                    charity done by GoodIntentions. The emails sent through the 
                    server were divided into parts to avoid load on the server 
                    of CauliflowerOnline. The emails sent to the users by Jeremy 
                    Reynolds also had an option to “opt out” which upon selecting 
                    would let users not receive any further emails from GoodIntentions 
                    charity.

        <p>
            GoodIntentions Charity is a unique charity that aims to help the 
            impoverished through the sale of our merchandise in our retail 
            stores. We opened our stores for the sole purpose of helping people 
            and families throughout the area. We do not operate to make a profit. 
            That is why we are registered as a non-profit organization. We as a 
            group only have good intentions in whatever action that we take. It 
            was with that idea that we called ourselves the GoodIntentions charity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main goal of GoodIntentions was to create awareness of our existence. 
            Since everyone has an email account these we decided that sending 
            people emails about our mission and our methods would bring about 
            a greater awareness in people of what we do. One of our members 
            Jeremy Reynolds was astute enough to notice that the only way to help 
            more people was to reach out to people and let them know of our purpose. 
            He decided that sending emails with our motivations and purpose with a 
            few merchandise was the best way to reach out to new people. Through a 
            business partner he was able to obtain mailing lists of people from 
            CauliflowerOnline among other email services. It was a fully legal 
            approach to expanding our network of potential customers, who are 
            also donors when they make purchases at GoodIntentions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The focus of the emails were the message to help those who were 
            impoverished. That was the only goal. There was of course some 
            merchandise in the emails but that was just an aside on the 
            overall plan. They were there solely so that if the recipients 
            felt compelled enough to donate after reading our cause then they 
            could choose to do so. Jeremy having the technical knowledge about 
            these things decided to send mass emails to people in hopes to get 
            more donations. He had only good intentions in mind while he did this. 
            He reasoned that the more emails we send the more people will be 
            compelled to look at our message. There was no hidden motivation 
            to gain money. As we have said before, we are a non-profit organization. 
            Profit is the last thing we are after. We only want to help those in need.

                The emails contained merchandise that were available for sale. 
                One of the side goals was to get money from the email recipients 
                as well. The placement of merchandise was intentional.

                The emails did not cause a significant lag which resulted in minimal 
                complaints from the users. The email list was obtained legally. The 
                emails were sent periodically so that the servers would not get overloaded.
