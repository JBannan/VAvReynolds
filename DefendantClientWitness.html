            Defendant Witness: Jeremy Reynolds
        </h2>
        <p>
            Jeremy Reynolds is a member of GoodIntentions of Greater Washington. GoodIntentions 
            is a non-profit organization known for retail stores across the D.C. metropolitan area. 
            Jeremy Reynolds has been a renowned member of GoodIntentions charity for a long time. 
            Jeremy Reynolds has a good history of being a charitable member of GoodIntention and 
            his work for the better future of the impoverished has also been appreciated by many.

            Jeremy Reynolds has been looking over to expand the charity reach and also gather more 
            and more charity for the impoverished who are benefited by GoodIntentions. To get greater 
            attention to the GoodIntentions and how the charity is being done for the impoverished 
            by the GoodIntentions, Jeremy Reynolds decided to send out emails. Reynolds gathered 
            the emails of users of CauliflowerOnline email service, knowing that CauliflowerOnline 
            has a reliable server which has users who might be willing to help the good cause. To 
            spread the history of GoodIntentions and how the organization achieves their mission, 
            Reynolds sent out over 12,000 unsolicited emails to users of CauliflowerOnline on 4 
            separate occasions. These emails contained an overview of work done by the GoodIntentions 
            and how the charity works. The email also contained the advertisement of the merchandise 
            and the stores which help the charity done by GoodIntentions. The emails contained the 
            information that when a merchandise is being purchased from the mentioned retail stores, 
            the profits are donated to the charity which supports GoodIntentions. Reynolds was sending 
            out these emails, thinking that it was protected speech as the emails were helping the 
            charity of GoodIntentions and did not support major commercial advertisement.

            Knowing that some users of CauliflowerOnline might not be interested in receiving any 
            further emails about GoodIntention and its charity, Reynolds also included an “opt out” 
            option in the emails so that the users can avoid receiving any more emails from GoodIntention. 
            This option was introduced to provide convenience to any users who would not like any more 
            emails from GoodIntentions.

                The email addresses of the users of CauliflowerOnline were obtained by 
                Jeremy Reynolds from the business partners of GoodIntentions. The emails 
                were indeed non-commercial in nature but did violate the spam laws as they 
                still appeared to be unsolicited. The emails sent to the users of 
                CauliflowerOnline contained merchandise which in a sense advertised the 
                merchandise more than the message of the good cause by GoodIntentions charity.

                    Jeremy Reynolds had no intention to generate commercial profits off of 
                    recipients -- the emails were only to spread the 
                    word of GoodIntentions and the community services they provide to the 
                    citizens of the D.C. metro area. The emails sent to the users by Jeremy 
                    Reynolds also had an option to “opt out” which upon selecting 
                    would let users not receive any further emails from GoodIntentions 
                    charity.
